Oh, what a situation that don't wanna stop

"Tomorrow Comes Today"
Everybody's here with me
Got no camera to see
Don't think I'm not all in this world
The camera won't let me go
And the verdict doesn't love our soul
The digital won't let me go
Yeah yeah yeah
I'll pay (yeah yeah yeah)
When tomorrow
Tomorrow comes today
Stereo I want it on
It's taken me far too long
Don't think I'm not all in this world
I don't think I'll be here too long
I don't think I'll be here too long, no (I don't think I'll be here too long)
I don't think I'll be here too long (I don't think I'll be here too long)
Yeah yeah yeah

When tomorrow (tomorrow)
Tomorrow comes today (tomorrow comes today)
(Don't think I'm not all in this world)...
(Don't, this world)...
Dream of my world
I live on my world
Going off my head, down to somewhere
Goin' on a dance all tune
In a pressure today
I blew a bad man away today
Had a gun, had to be done
I blew a man away
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet, yeah, yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Dream on the street
People passing through me, yes, they do
Well, my friend, won't my heart mend ?
I'm gonna bring it all back
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
Don't trust people you meet yeah
They might promise you
That the river ain't deep
Brother, sister too
Do what you must do
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
Yeah... Ha Ha!
Finally someone let me out of my cage
Now, time for me is nothing cause I'm counting no age
Now I couldn't be there
Now you shouldn't be scared
I'm good at repairs
And I'm under each snare
Intangible
Bet you didn't think so I command you to
Panoramic view
Look I'll make it all manageable
Pick and choose
Sit and lose
All you different crews
Chicks and dudes
Who you think is really kickin' tunes?
Picture you gettin' down in a picture tube
Like you lit the fuse
You think it's fictional?
Mystical? Maybe.
Spiritual
Hero who appears in you to clear your view when you're too crazy
Lifeless
To those the definition for what life is
Priceless
To you because I put you on the high shit
You like it?
Gun smokin' righteous with one toke
You're psychic among those
Possess you with one go
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future (that's right) is coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
It's coming on
The essence the basics
Without did you make it
Allow me to make this
Child-like in nature
Rhythm
You have it or you don't that's a fallacy
I'm in them
Every sprouting tree
Every child of peace
Every cloud and sea
You see with your eyes
I see destruction and demise (that's right)
Corruption in disguise
From this fuckin' enterprise
Now I'm sucked into your lies
Through Russel, not his muscles but percussion he provides
For me as a guide
Y'all can see me now 'cause you don't see with your eye
You perceive with your mind
That's the inner
So I'mma stick around with Russ and be a mentor
Bust a few rhymes so motherfuckers remember where the thought is
I brought all this
So you can survive when law is lawless (right here)
Feelings, sensations that you thought was dead
No squealing, remember that it's all in your head
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
The future is coming on
I ain't happy, I'm feeling glad
I got sunshine in a bag
I'm useless but not for long
My future is coming on

This is a breakfast club!
Bring me coffee in the lawn
I see the tafil in the sand
Like a sunshine I got you
Nothing, nothing you can do
Bring me junkie in the lawn
He said nothing in the tongue
To kill that model from my door
Must kill that model from my door
To kill that model from my door, oh yeah
Must kill that model from my door, my door
Try to see myself what goes on
Make it up myself, I'll never
Always told my thoughts aloud
Then another day I shut up
Back to the sand
Doing what you can
Bound to be gone
Damned a loser
Found out right then they were fed up
Cause everybody said to shut up
Yeah!
Thought that you might care what goes on
Try to say "what up?"; I'm fed up
Everybody said to shut up
The last time I told them "what up?"
Down with the sun
I knew that I was done
Did it to my self
Did it to my self, and then
All this time I said I've been fed up
Cause everybody tells me "shut up"

I know you like that, you want to try that
It's like a flashback, so shake your ass crack
I got the balls to rock the salsa
Funk the blues-a, any groove to
Make your move, 'cause taking you to
Another landscape is my mandate
I'm highly animated even though I'm decomposin'
So if your feet is frozen, I'ma die to see you ropin'
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting
I want y'all to just get down
Tap your toes and clap your hands
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, trace the globe and shake your pants
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Just twist your hip and do the dip
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Come on, shake and bake, do whatever it takes
(How many people ready to rock the house?)
Gravitational pull'll have you making a fool
Out of yourself on the dance floor
Doing back spins, running man and more
Party down with vigor and candor
Coming to the jam or look like a landlubber
And do the aqua boogie, win lots of goodies maybe
Pop a Gucci wallet, turntables is talking to me
It's awfully groovy, seeing all the treasure and the booty
And when the MC rhyme and the DJ spin
I want y'all to just get down
Now while the MC rhyming and the DJ cutting

I want to get down lower than Atlantis
Going toe to toe with an enchantress
Get funkier than Funkadelic wearing Pampers
While you eggheads is on the wall preparing answers
Sharing transcripts, while we over here
Dipping and dancing, rhythm romancing
Wallflowers, giving no action, no
All hours we chillin' and maxin'
So relaxin', opposites attractin'
I'ma toss my hat in, floss when the track spin
Like I'm on a crack bend, jigglin' and wigglin'
Freaking booties, speaking to the cuties so belligerent
No religion, just bump the feed on
You'll feel reborn, negativity we just dead it like decoy
Better lift your feet and just measure the beat on
The pulse when it responds
